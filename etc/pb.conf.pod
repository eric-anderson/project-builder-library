=head1 NAME

Documentation for pb configuration files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

pb helps you build various packages directly from your project sources. 
In order to work correctly, it relies on a certain number of configuration files. Most of these configuration parameters can be setup in all the configuration files, however, they generally make more sense in a specific one, which is indicated. There are mainly 4 configuration files, the one in the home directory of the user (used first), the one from the project (use in second), the one in the VM/VE hosting directory, and the one provided by the tool in /etc/pb or /usr/local/etc/pb (lastly).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Those files have the same format, which is near from a a perl hash structure:
keyword key = value1[,value2,...]

The key could be also default, in which case it will be used as a default value if no more precise content is given for the key.

Each value is detailed below giving the nature of its use (Mandatory or Optional - only used for certain feature), the value of the key (could be the project, an OS name, default, ...), the value of the parameter field and its format, the default configuration file in which it should be defined (home $HOME/.pbrc, conf /etc/pb/pb.conf or /usr/local/etc/pb/pb.conf, VE vepath/.pbrc, VM vmpath/.pbrc,  or project project.pb) and an example of use.
